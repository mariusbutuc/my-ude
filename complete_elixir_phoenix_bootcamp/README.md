# [The Complete Elixir and Phoenix Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-elixir-and-phoenix-bootcamp-and-tutorial)

  - We played with [Lists][docs-list], let's learn about [Tuples][docs-tuple]:

    > "like an array, where each index has a very special meaning"

    + the ordering / contract is in the developer's head!
    + can be seen as a key/value pair, where the key is the index

  - [List comprehension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_comprehension)
    - create a list based on existing lists
    - _distinct_ from the use of map and filter functions

  - [There are no methods in Elixir—just **functions**](https://elixirforum.com/t/there-are-no-methods-in-elixir-just-functions/2451):

    > There are no objects in Elixir (nor methods). If they are about structs, then they should be referred to as structs (or generally as data) (and use "functions" instead of "methods").

    –José Valim
